# Python Dig


#### *Learn Python’s more advanced features by tinkering with some demo snippets,  for a few minutes each day*

### Why?
Sometimes all you need to grasp an idea is to play around with some code. Run a script, add a breakpoint, change a line or two, and run the script again.

### What is the Goal here?
Python is pretty powerful even with its basic features. Usually, you don't need the fancy stuff. So why bother?

* It’s fun! Python is brilliantly designed and so much fun to delve into.

* Once in a while there's this tricky case that can be handled smoothly with an advanced feature.

* Developing libraries, tools, utilities & frameworks.
* Refactoring messy codebase, particularly with a lot of repetitive code.

### How to use this repo?
Just clone this repo next to your work stuff. Every now and then take 10-15 minutes to tinker with a single script. Run it, debug it, modify the code, add some comments.
This should fit even to a busy schedule, one step at a time.

The scripts aren't really helpful on their own, and don't lead to a complete system - they're just to demonstrate a point.
Helpful features become apparent with progress, and are eventually used often.

### Credits
These snippets are based-on/inspired-by countless videos, blog posts, courses, documentation, books &  Stackoverflow answers. The primary Guru’s are David Beazley, Raymond Hettinger, Martijn Pieters & Brandon Rhodes.

In order not to get the busy programmer bogged down by a ton of further readings, 
only when a reference is absolutely necessary to better understand the snippet, it’s there.
There is also a list of recommended resources, if you got the time, but the idea is just to jump to a random snippet at a time and tinker with it.

### Run the code
Use Python 3.10, but most of the scripts will probably run w/o an issue on earlier versions (pyenv is useful if your OS bundled Python is less than 3.10).

Easiest would be to `cd` the repo directory, and then:
```
$ pyenv local 3.10   (if required) 
$ poetry shell
